1. File List: 
(1) PacIFlora - Full list format of all records (species x island, including records with no information on island but just island group level and records that could not be identified by the LCVP), Suppl. material 2.

Additionally, you can find the following files:

(2) An island × species matrix, excluding records that were missing information. Specifically, this list does not include data that have no island information, or species that could not be identified by the LCVP. (Dryad only)

(3) An aggregated island group × species matrix. (Dryad only)

(4) A table to access reference IDs, Suppl. material 3.

(5) List format of PacIFLora on island level, excluding all records with no information on island but just island group level and records that could not be identified by the LCVP. (Dryad only)

(6) List format of PacIFLora on island group level, excluding all records that could not be identified by the LCVP and providing aggregated values for naturalization, cultivation and invasion status. (Dryad only)

2. Relationship between files, if important: 
All Files (except for the phylogeny and supplementary files) can be created from the list format of PacIFlora 


METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

 

To create a matrix of species presences on islands and island groups, we used raw data from GloNAF version 1.1 and raw data from PIER (updated 2nd of June 2018). Both PIER and GloNAF list their sources for all records of a naturalized species on an island.

We harmonized species names using the LCVP (Freiberg et al. 2020) and the associated R-package ‘lcvplants’ (https://github.com/idiv-biodiversity/LCVP). Subspecies and varieties were aggregated to the binomial level, which we refer to as “species” level for simplicity. If a hybrid taxon was not recorded in the LCVP database, it was pooled with the first parent species, affecting 20 species. Forty species names were identified by the LCVP as synonyms for more than one possible species. In these cases, we chose the first species name provided by the LCVP as assigned name to assure reproducibility. Twenty species could not be linked to an accepted name by the LCVP with certainty and were assigned ‘NA’ values for species name, family and order. We kept these unassignable species in the list format of PacIFlora to allow for future name resolution.

All calculations were performed and graphs were created using R (version 4.0.3, R Core Team 2020). Maps were created using R and the packages ‘ggplot2’ (Wickham 2016), ‘ggtree’ (Yu 2020) and ‘rnaturalearth’ (South 2017) for visualization. We created background polygons for island group association using QGis 3.12.3 (QGIS Development Team 2021). Matrix aggregation was performed using the fuzzySim package in R (Barbosa 2015).

PacIFlora includes the following columns: ID, Species, Island, Island group, Family, Order, Native, Cultivated, Source, Original_Name, Invasion. ID provides an unique number. Species is the accepted name of the species based on the LCVP. 3963 species where recorded. Island is the location where the species is present. Islands often have many names or different spellings. We used web research and other information in our sources to identify synonyms, and chose one name from the sources (usually the most commonly used name). Island refers to the smallest available unit of reference and is therefore sometimes used for several unnamed islets of an atoll in close proximity which are not or only sometimes (tidally) connected by land. 488 islands where recorded. IslandGroup is a group name assigned by us. The inclusion of island groupings is useful for many types of research questions, as a complete species list at a broader spatial scale decreases problems of data deficiency for individual islands in an archipelago. Our groups are largely based on political borders, such as municipalities or states. If political borders did not reflect geographic borders, we used distance between islands and ocean trenches to assign each island to one of 50 island groups. Island group aggregation is visualized in Fig. 1. We excluded 146 records that could not be linked to any island group. This particular grouping is useful for questions related to the influence of dispersal barriers on biological invasions, as distance creates a natural barrier and political borders are known to influence dispersal via human imports (either intentional or accidental). However, islands also vary in age, size and geomorphology, and thus we make it possible to regroup the islands in our database into formats that might be better suited for other research questions (e.g. on establishment barriers). Family is the plant family and Order is the plant order. Native status indicates the certainty if the species is native at the given location. While all of the species in PacIFlora are naturalized in at least one location in the Pacific, some species might be native in other locations of the Pacific. We assigned numerical values indicating certainty of native status on each specific island between 0 (unanimously described as naturalized on the specific island) and 1 (unanimously described as native on the specific island) to the categorical classes defined in GloNAF and PIER, which were averaged if there was not agreement among the sources. There were 36 species with only “native” records, which were excluded. The vast majority of records (94%) are not described as likely native. A total of 255 species were described at least once as likely native (Fig. 2). Cultivated provides information whether the species is classified as being only cultivated on the island or island group. Cultivated values of one define species that are only known to exist in horticultural plantings at the location, whereas those clearly described as naturalized by any source at the location are given a value of zero. A value of 0.5 indicates that there is no information available documenting whether the species is either cultivated or naturalized at the location. There were 40 species with only “cultivated” records, which were excluded. A total of 19.944 records were described as not cultivated, 9150 had no information on cultivation status, and 4207 were described as cultivated. A total of 630 (16%) species were described as cultivated at least once, which also means that those species escaped cultivation at least once. Cultivated and native scores were determined differently since a species can be both cultivated and naturalized on an island, but not native and alien. Database indicates if the record was present in GloNAF (glon), PIER (pier) or both (glon_pier). Orignal_Name shows the species name prior to standardization. Invasive status is a column indicating invasive status of the species on a given island, which “1” meaning unanimously described as invasive in this location, “0” meaning unanimously described as not invasive. The value in this column was achieved by forming a mean of the evaluation of all records for a particular species island combination, why this column should be handled with care, as there was no information if one occurence was evaluated differently by different authors or if two different occurrences on one island were evaluated differently. In total, 15.713 records where described as likely invasive, including 1550 species. Source provides the original reference as listed in GloNAF and PIER. Only one reference is provided for each record, additional references can be accessed via the Source_ID column, which lists the IDs of all references listing this record. References for the IDs can be found in the Suppl. material 3. Most records have only one record but a record can have as many as eighteen references (e.g. due to voucher specimens). An overview of the 22 most frequently used sources can be seen in Table 1.Latitude and Longitude gives the geographical coordinates of the island centroid in decimal degrees, which were taken from the Global Inventory of Floras and Traits (GIFT) database (Weigelt et al. 2013, Weigelt et al. 2019). In total 84 islands could not be connected to a unique ID in GIFT; coordinates for these were taken from Google Maps (Google, 2020). All coordinates are provided in WGS84.
